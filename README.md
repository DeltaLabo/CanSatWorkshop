# CanSat Workshop

This project aims to launch a beginner-friendly CanSat workshop, researched, developed, and taught by Delta Lab members.

See the **Issues** tab for tasks.
See you corresponding subsystem folder for more documentation, including architecture diagrams and functional versions.

## Requirements

- **Must** be specifically design as a tool for teaching system integration engineering principles.
- **Must** be fully documented for future reproduction by a completely different team
- **Shall** have an instructible document with subsystems descriptions and proposed activities designed for educational purposes

## Administrative Requirements

- Each subsystem **must** create a detailed guide document with clear instructions for assembly, integration, and testing.
- Each subsystem **should** create a list of materials with descriptions, and this list must be in Notion.
- All documents and information for the CanSat project **must be** organized in Github, classified by subsystem, to facilitate access and management.
- All subsystems **must be** compatible with each other in terms of size, connection, and operation, allowing effective integration that facilitates cohesion and overall performance of the CanSat.
- Each subsystem **must** complete a testing and validation process to ensure it meets operational requirements under mission conditions.
