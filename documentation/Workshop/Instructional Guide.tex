\section{Introduction}

This workshop offers students a hands-on introduction to systems integration through the assembly and testing of a CanSat—an educational satellite model designed for learning purposes. Rather than simulating complex aerospace missions, the main objective is to provide a first experience in integrating multiple subsystems into a single, functional system.

The course begins with a session on Systems Engineering, giving students foundational concepts and tools to approach the design and organization of interconnected components. From the outset, participants will work with the structural frame, a lightweight and modular chassis that supports and protects all internal components. They will also use a BackPlane, a custom-designed printed circuit board that helps organize and stabilize power and data connections between subsystems.

Throughout the workshop, students will explore key components such as the Attitude Determination System (for orientation tracking via GPS and IMU), the Atmospheric Measurement System (for monitoring environmental conditions), the Data Processing System (for managing and analyzing sensor data), and the Energy Storage and Power Distribution Systems (for supplying and regulating electrical power). They will also configure the On-Board Computer and Communications (for coordinating system functions and transmitting telemetry), and test the Parachute Deployment Mechanism (for ensuring a safe and controlled descent).

As the workshop progresses, participants will learn how each subsystem contributes to the overall mission, how to code and integrate functional components, and how to apply engineering principles to solve real-world challenges. By the end of the course, students will have developed a practical understanding of subsystem interaction, system-level integration, and data analysis—culminating in the actual launch and operational testing of their CanSat.

\section{Objectives}

\textbf{General Objective: }
\\
To provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the CanSat system by exploring its subsystems, fostering practical skills in System Engineering design and programming, and enabling the evaluation of system performance through hands-on experimentation and data analysis.


\textbf{Specific Objectives:}
\\
After completing the workshop the participant will be able to:

Understand the fundamentals of Systems Engineering and recognizes their importance in the design and integration of CanSat subsystems.

Apply theoretical concepts to program solutions and analyze CAD models that support the functioning of each CanSat subsystem.

Implement and test the CanSat subsystems through hands-on activities, and analyzes their performance after an experimental launch by collecting relevant data and drawing evidence-based conclusions.

\section{Workshop Overview}

This document contains detailed information about the CanSat Workshop, organized at the Delta Laboratory. The workshop will last for two days, running from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and will be structured into eight sessions.

The first session will provide an introduction to Systems Engineering. Afterward, the different CanSat subsystems will be addressed, starting with structures, as this subsystem integrates and connects all the others. The following six subsystems will then be explored: ESS, PDS, AMS, OBCC, ADS, PDM and S A. 

Each session will last approximately two hours. During this time, the instructor will present a theoretical introduction to the corresponding subsystem and its functionality, using presentations and CAD representations. Participants will then be required to complete the assigned code for each subsystem, promoting a hands-on and interactive learning experience.

At the end of the technical sessions, the CanSats will be launched, allowing for the evaluation of the parachute deployment and the data collection process. Finally, a dedicated session will be held for data analysis and interpretation, aiming to assess system performance and draw relevant conclusions.

The CanSat Workshop offers participants a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience focused on the design, integration, and operation of a miniaturized satellite system. Throughout the workshop, attendees will explore fundamental concepts of Systems Engineering and gain practical knowledge about the key subsystems that make up a CanSat, including structural integration, energy storage, atmospheric measurement, data processing, and communication systems.

This workshop is designed to strengthen technical skills, foster teamwork, and encourage problem-solving abilities essential for careers in aerospace, electronics, and systems engineering.
