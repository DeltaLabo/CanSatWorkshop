*Derivation of formula for required sample
size when testing proportions*
|
The method of determining sample sizes for testing proportions is similar
to the method for [determining sample sizes for
testing the mean](prc222.htm). Although the sampling distribution for proportions
actually follows a binomial distribution, the normal approximation
is used for this derivation.
|
*Problem formulation*
|
We want to test the hypothesis
\(H_0: \,\, p = p_0\)
\(H_a: \,\, p \ne p_0\)
with \(p\)
denoting the proportion of defectives.
Define \(\delta\)
as the change in the proportion defective that we are interested
in detecting
\(\delta = | p_1 - p_0|\).
Specify the level of statisitical significance and statistical
power, respectively, by
|
*Definition of allowable deviation*
|
If we are interested in detecting a change in the proportion defective
of size \(\delta\)
in either direction, the corresponding confidence interval for \(p\)
can be written as
$$ \hat{p} - \delta \le p \le \hat{p} + \delta \, . $$
|
*Relationship to confidence interval*
|
For a \(100(1-\alpha)\) %
confidence interval based on the normal distribution, where \(z_{1 - \alpha/2}\)
is the [critical value of
the normal distribution](../../eda/section3/eda3671.htm) which is exceeded with probability \(\alpha/2\),
is
$$ \delta = z_{1-\alpha/2} \, \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1-p_0)}{N}} + z_{1-\beta} \,
\sqrt{\frac{p_1 (1-p_1)}{N}} \, . $$
|
*Minimum sample size*
|
Thus, the minimum sample size is
- For a two-sided interval
$$ N \ge \left( \frac{z_{1-\alpha/2} \,
\sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0)} + z_{1-\beta} \,
\sqrt{p_1 (1-p_1)}}{\delta} \, \right)^2 \, . $$
- For a one-sided interval
$$ N \ge \left( \frac{z_{1-\alpha} \, \sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0)} + z_{1-\beta}
\, \sqrt{p_1 (1-p_1)}}{\delta} \, \right)^2 \, . $$
The mathematical details of this derivation are given on pages
30-34 of
[Fleiss, Levin, and Paik](../section5/prc5.htm#Fleiss).
|
*Continuity correction*
|
Fleiss, Levin, and Paik also recommend the following continuity
correction,
\( N = N' + 1/\delta \, , \)
with \(N'\)
denoting the sample size computed using the above formula.

*Example of calculating sample size for testing
proportion defective*
|
Suppose that a department manager needs to be able to detect any
change above 0.10 in the current proportion defective of his product
line, which is running at approximately 10 % defective. He is interested
in a one-sided test and does not want to stop the line except
when the process has clearly degraded and, therefore, he chooses a
significance level for the test of 5 %. Suppose, also, that he is
willing to take a risk of 10 % of failing to detect a change of this
magnitude. With these criteria:
- \(z_{0.95} = 1.645 , \,\, z_{0.90} = 1.282\)
- \(\delta = 0.10 \,\, (p_1 = 0.20)\)
- \(p_0 = 0.10\)
and the minimum sample size for a [one-sided test
procedure](prc24.htm) is
$$\begin{eqnarray}
N & \ge & \left( \frac{z_{1-\alpha} \, \sqrt{p_0 (1-p_0)} + z_{1-\beta} \, \sqrt{p_1 (1-p_1)}}{\delta} \, \right)^2 \\
& & \\
& = & \left( \frac{1.645 \, \sqrt{0.1 \times 0.9} + 1.282 \, \sqrt{0.2 \times 0.8}}{0.1} \, \right)^2 \\
& & \\
& \approx & 102 \, .
\end{eqnarray} $$
With the continuity correction, the minimum sample size becomes 112.
